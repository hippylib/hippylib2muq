> An Extensible Software Framework for Large-scale Bayesian Inverse Problems

## Overview

`hIPPYlib-MUQ` is a Python interface between two open source softwares, `hIPPYlib` 
and `MUQ`, which have complementary capabilities. [`hIPPYlib`](https://hippylib.github.io) is an extensible 
software package aimed at solving deterministic and linearized Bayesian inverse 
problems governed by PDEs.
[`MUQ`](http://muq.mit.edu/) is a collection of tools for solving uncertainty quantification problems. 
`hIPPYlib-MUQ` integrates these two libraries into a unique software framework, 
allowing users to implement the state-of-the-art Bayesian inversion algorithms 
in a seamless way. 

To get started, we recommend to follow the interactive tutorials in `tutorial`
folder.
