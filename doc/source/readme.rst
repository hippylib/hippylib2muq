    Scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo Sampling Methods for Large-scale Bayesian 
    Inverse Problems Governed by PDEs


``hIPPYlib-MUQ`` is a Python interface between two open source softwares, ``hIPPYlib``
and ``MUQ``, which have complementary capabilities. `hIPPYlib <https://hippylib.github.io>`_ 
is an extensible software package aimed at solving deterministic and linearized Bayesian inverse 
problems governed by PDEs.
`MUQ <http://muq.mit.edu/>`_ is a collection of tools for solving uncertainty quantification problems. 
``hIPPYlib-MUQ`` integrates these two libraries into a unique software framework, 
allowing users to implement the state-of-the-art Bayesian inversion algorithms 
in a seamless way. 

Please look into example notebook below to get to know what ``hIPPYlib-MUQ``
does with step-by-step implementations.
